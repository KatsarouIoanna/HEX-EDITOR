WHAT IS A HEX EDITOR?
A hex editor is a computer program used for viewing and editing binary files. 
Hex editors display the content of files in hexadecimal (base-16) format.

In a hex editor, each byte of data is represented by two hexadecimal digits, allowing you to view and edit the binary data of a file.
